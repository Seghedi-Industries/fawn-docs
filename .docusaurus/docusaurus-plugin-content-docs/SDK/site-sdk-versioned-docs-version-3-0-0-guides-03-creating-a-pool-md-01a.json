  "description": "This guide extends the previous getting started guide by using the fetched data from the EVM to create a Pool instance using the V3 SDK. A \"Pool\" as we refer to it here does not mean an actual V3 pool, but a model of one created with the SDK. This model will help us interact with the protocol, or manipulate data relevant to the protocol, in a way that does not require continually fetching pool data from the EVM - which can be time intensive and computationally costly.",
